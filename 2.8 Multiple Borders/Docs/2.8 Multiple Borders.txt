Start defining a border.
Place a second border around.
We create another element around using the ::after pseudo element.

We place the new element inside his container so:
- container - position: relative
- container:after - position: absolute top, left, right, bottom set to -5px and z-index: -1

In that container we can create another border:
- 2px solid yellow

Now we have 3 borders.
We can also add the ::before element and make the same thing, that way we define more borders.

We can create an inset border:
- remove the z-index 
- top, bottom, left, right elements set to 5px
