Add a border to the edge of the container and make him semi-transparent.

Use the background-clip property.

background-clip: border-box|padding-box|content-box|initial|inherit

i.e
background-clip: padding-box. 

Clips away the white backgound of the border and we can see right through in to the image behind it.
